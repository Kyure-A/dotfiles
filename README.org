* Required package before install
- git
- zsh

* Installation
If zsh is not the default, you can run the command below. (dotfiles are for zsh)

#+BEGIN_SRC your-default-shell 
chsh -s /bin/zsh
exec $SHELL -l
#+END_SRC

To do the installation, all you have to do is copy and paste the 3 lines of command below and run it.

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Kyure-A/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
zsh ./installer.sh
#+END_SRC

If you want to adapt the settings, restart the shell or run ~exec $SHELL -l~ .

* Why chose GPL-3.0?
I thought the licence was appropriate, but then I thought about it and remembered that it contains snippets of [[https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets][yasnippet-snippets]]. That is why I chose GPL-3.0 that were chosen [[https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets][yasnippet-snippets]].

This is a 'licence infection' so to speak (but it does not mean I do not want to comply with the GPL, and I do not mean that in a malicious way - I rather appreciate it).
